A number of the podcast episodes [listed above](#podcast-episodes-GCBRS) discuss some of the most promising ideas, as do many of the papers in the \"Other resources\" section [above](#other-resources-GCBRs).`]","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:127":"Learn more about these ideas and others in our [interview with Dr Cassidy Nelson](/podcast/episodes/cassidy-nelson-12-ways-to-stop-pandemics/).","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:129":"### Most existing work is not aimed at reducing risks of the worst outcomes.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:131":"The broader field of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness has made major contributions to GCBR reduction. Many of the best ways to prepare for more probable but less severe outbreaks will also reduce GCBRs, so many people who are not concerned with GCBRs in particular still do work that is useful for reducing them. For this reason, we think advancing parts of the broader field — especially in areas like vaccine research or broad-spectrum treatments — can be very valuable, even from the perspective of just trying to reduce the chances or severity of the worst potential outbreaks.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:133":"There may be even more valuable opportunities. It seems to be relatively uncommon for people in the broader field of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness to aim their work specifically at reducing GCBRs. Projects that disproportionately reduce GCBRs also seem to receive a relatively small proportion of health security funding.[^:`Greg Lewis estimates that a quality-adjusted ~1 billion USD is spent annually on GCBR reduction. Most of this comes from work that is not explicitly targeted at GCBRs, but is rather disproportionally useful for reducing them. The US budget for health security in general is ~14 billion. Worldwide the budget is probably something like double or triple that, so spending that's particularly helpful for GCBR reduction is probably just a few percent of the total; the spending for explicit GCBR reduction would be much less. See the [relevant section of our GCBR profile](/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/full-report/#gcbrs-may-be-both-neglected-and-tractable), including footnote 21.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:135":"Why might people focus less on work targeted toward GCBRs, even though they are the risks of the worst catastrophes? One answer is that people with the power to allocate resources are not sufficiently aware of GCBRs, or think that they are extremely low. Another answer is short-term thinking: since the technologies most worrying for GCBRs haven't yet been fully developed, it's very unlikely we'll see a biological catastrophe in the next few years; people subject to political and other pressures to prioritise the near future may therefore be less inclined to focus on them. Finally, GCBRs are a type of ' [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics))' problem, so we generally have reason to expect them to be somewhat neglected. [Read more](/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/full-report/#gcbrs-may-be-both-neglected-and-tractable).`] In our view, the costs of biological disasters grow nonlinearly with severity because of the increasing potential for the event to contribute to [existential risk](/articles/existential-risks). This suggests that projects that reduce GCBRs in particular should receive more funding and attention than they currently seem to.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:137":"Moreover, insofar as more targeted interventions would be useful (and we’d guess they would be[^:`How useful more targeted work is for reducing GCBRs vs growing the broader field of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness is a matter of debate. In a [recent podcast episode](/podcast/episodes/marc-lipsitch-winning-or-losing-against-covid19-and-epidemiology/), Marc Lipsitch argued that the best way to address GCBRs may be to simply build up the broader field, because of the substantial overlap between biological threats of all sizes and the tools needed to combat them. In our writeup on reducing GCBRs, [Greg Lewis suggested](/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/full-report/#convergence-and-the-portfolio) that this strategy — which he calls \"buying the index\" of conventional biosecurity — would probably be less effective than trying to complement the existing portfolio with work that's particularly important for reducing GCBRs.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:139":"We suspect Greg's view is closer to the truth, though it's not obvious, and Greg also expresses uncertainty on the matter. We have a general heuristic: all else equal, a more targeted intervention -- one whose primary goal is to make progress on a smaller number of issues -- is likely to have a bigger effect _on those issues_ than a less targeted intervention that has more goals. In pursuing the less targeted intervention, you can face more tradeoffs between the different goals, which can reduce your impact on each one considered separately.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:141":"Furthermore, with regard to this particular case: the people who have shaped the broader field of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness seem to have generally been optimising for reducing the risks of smaller, more likely pandemic outbreaks. It would be surprising if in doing so they also optimised the field for reducing GCBRs, such that just building the field in general was the best thing someone could do to reduce GCBRs.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:143":"That said, because there's already a lot of support for the kinds of interventions favoured by the broader field, including interventions that do reduce GCBRs, it could in some cases be higher impact to expand the field or in some other way make it more effective at achieving its goals. For example, if you could manage to expand the entire field by 1% in terms of funding and labour, that might easily be better than a more targeted project aimed at reducing GCBRs.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:145":"Indeed, Greg [also guesses](/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/full-report/#convergence-and-the-portfolio) that it's sometimes better to complement the existing biosecurity portfolio with work that's especially useful for reducing GCBRs (but which is also helpful for addressing threats of less severe events) than it would be to _explicitly_ target reducing GCBRs. This suggests that the argument for targeting interventions can be taken too far.`]) the fact that there is comparatively little work targeted toward reducing GCBRs right now suggests that the area is somewhat [neglected](/articles/problem-framework/). This means that if you enter the field of biosecurity and pandemic preparedness aiming to reduce GCBRs, there may be particularly good opportunities to do so that others have not already pursued.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:147":"If you do enter the field aiming to reduce GCBRs, it might be easier to work on broader efforts that have more mainstream support first, and then transition to more targeted projects later.","problem-profiles--preventing-catastrophic-pandemics:149":"If you are already working in biosecurity and pandemic preparedness (or a related field), this might be a good time to advocate for a greater focus on measures likely to help us with whatever outbreak surprises us next. There may be a greater openness to ideas in this area now, as people reflect on how underprepared we were for COVID-19.[^:`How to prevent the next unknown would-be pandemic is, of course, an existing field of research. The COVID-19 pandemic may raise this field's profile, or it might lower it. This depends on whether enough people are inspired to focus on preventing anything like COVID-19 (or worse) from happening in the future, or if the large majority of people prioritise combating the current crisis.
