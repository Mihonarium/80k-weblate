In these model scenarios, various soot clouds containing uncertain quantities of soot were assumed to form over cities, oil refineries, and more rural missile silos. Once the quantity of soot is decided upon by the researchers, the climate effects of these soot clouds are then modeled. The term \"nuclear winter\" was coined in 1983 by Richard P.

  "articles--existential-risks:500": "### 2\\. Broad efforts to reduce risks",
  "articles--existential-risks:502": "Rather than try to reduce each risk individually, we can try to make civilisation generally better at managing them. The “broad” efforts help to reduce all the threats at once, even those we haven’t thought of yet.",
  "articles--existential-risks:504": "For instance, there are key decision-makers, often in government, who will need to manage these risks as they arise. If we could improve the decision-making ability of these people and institutions, then it would help to make society in general more resilient, and solve many other problems.",
  "articles--existential-risks:506": "Recent research has uncovered lots of ways to improve decision-making, but most of it hasn’t yet been implemented. At the same time, few people are working on the issue. We go into more depth in our write-up of [improving institutional decision-making](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/).",
  "articles--existential-risks:508": "Another example is that we could try to make it easier for civilisation to rebound from a catastrophe. The Global Seed Vault is a frozen vault in the Arctic, which contains the seeds of many important crop varieties, reducing the chance we lose an important species. Melting water [recently entered the tunnel leading to the vault](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/19/arctic-stronghold-of-worlds-seeds-flooded-after-permafrost-melts) due, ironically, to climate change, so could probably use more funding. There are lots of other projects like this we could do to preserve knowledge.",
  "articles--existential-risks:510": "Similarly, we could [create better disaster shelters](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/disaster-shelters), which would reduce the chance of extinction from pandemics, nuclear winter and asteroids (though not AI), while also increasing the chance of a recovery after a disaster. Right now, these measures don’t seem as effective as reducing the risks in the first place, but they still help. A more neglected, and perhaps much cheaper option is to create [alternative food sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What), such as those that can be produced without light, and could be quickly scaled up in a prolonged winter.",
  "articles--existential-risks:512": "Since broad efforts help even if we’re not sure about the details of the risks, they’re more attractive the more uncertain you are.

  "articles--existential-risks:514": "We expect there are many more promising broad interventions, but it’s an area where little research has been done. For instance, another approach could involve improving international coordination. Since these risks are caused by humanity, they can be prevented by humanity, but what stops us is the [difficulty of coordination](https://conceptually.org/concepts/coordination-problems/). For instance, Russia doesn’t want to disarm because it would put it at a disadvantage compared to the US, and vice versa, even though both countries would be better off if there were no possibility of nuclear war.",
  "articles--existential-risks:516": "However, it might be possible to improve our ability to coordinate as a civilisation, such as by improving foreign relations or developing better international institutions. We’re keen to see more research into these kinds of proposals.",
  "articles--existential-risks:518": "Mainstream efforts to do good like improving education and international development can also help to make society more resilient and wise, and so also contribute to reducing catastrophic risks. For instance, a better educated population would probably elect more enlightened leaders (cough), and richer countries are, all else equal, better able to prevent pandemics — it’s no accident that Ebola took hold in some of the poorest parts of West Africa.",
  "articles--existential-risks:520": "But, we don’t see education and health as the best areas to focus on for two reasons. First, these areas are far less neglected than the more unconventional approaches we’ve covered. In fact, improving education is [perhaps the most popular cause](https://80000hours.org/2017/01/5-reasons-not-to-go-into-education/) for people who want to do good, and in the US alone, receives 800 billion dollars of government funding, and another trillion dollars of private funding. Second, these approaches have much more diffuse effects on reducing these risks — you’d have to improve education on a very large scale to have any noticeable effect. We prefer to focus on more targeted and neglected solutions.",
  "articles--existential-risks:522": "### 3\\. Learning more and building capacity",
  "articles--existential-risks:524": "We’re highly uncertain about which risks are biggest, what is best to do about them, and whether our whole picture of global priorities might be totally wrong. This means that another key goal is to learn more about all of these issues.",
  "articles--existential-risks:526": "We can learn more by simply trying to reduce these risks and seeing what progress can be made.

  "articles--existential-risks:528": "This is a combination of economics and moral philosophy, which aims to answer high-level questions about the most important issues for humanity. There are only a handful of researchers working full-time on these issues.",
  "articles--existential-risks:530": "Another way to handle uncertainty is to build up resources that can be deployed in the future when you have more information. One way of doing this is to earn and save money. You can also invest in your [career capital](/articles/career-capital), especially your transferable skills and influential connections, so that you can achieve more in the future.",
  "articles--existential-risks:532": "However, we think that a potentially better approach than either of these is to build a _community_ that’s focused on reducing these risks, whatever they turn out to be. The reason this can be better is that it’s possible to grow the capacity of a community faster than you can grow your individual wealth or career capital. For instance, if you spent a year doing targeted one-on-one outreach, it’s not out of the question to find one other person with relevant expertise to join you. This would be an annual return to the cause of about 100%.",
  "articles--existential-risks:534": "Right now, we are focused on [building the effective altruism community](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/), which contains many people who want to reduce these risks. Moreover, the recent rate of growth, and studies of specific efforts to grow the community, suggest that high rates of return are possible.",
  "articles--existential-risks:536": "However, we expect that other community building efforts will also be valuable. It would be great to see a community of scientists trying to promote a culture of safety in academia. It would be great to see a community of policymakers who want to try to reduce these risks, and make government have more concern for future generations.",

  "articles--existential-risks:546": "Here are some very rough and simplified figures, just to illustrate how this could be possible.

In other words, if the risk is 4% now, it could be reduced to 3%. A one percentage point reduction in the risk would be expected to save about 100 million lives (1% of 10 billion).

We think Greg is likely too conservative, because he assumes the risk of extinction is only 1% over the next century, when our estimate is that it’s several times higher. We also think the next billion dollars spent on reducing existential risk could cause a larger reduction in the risk than Greg assumes (note that this is only true if the billion were spent on the most neglected issues like AI safety and biorisk). As a result we wouldn’t be surprised if the cost per present lives saved for the next one billion dollars invested in reducing existential risk were under $100.",

  "articles--existential-risks:657": "Others have raised the concern that the development of advanced AI systems could cause terrible harm if it is done irresponsibly, perhaps because there is a conflict between several groups raising to develop the technology. In particular, if at some point in the future, developing these systems involves the creation of sentient digital minds, their wellbeing could become incredibly important.",
  "articles--existential-risks:659": "Risks of a future that contains an astronomical amount of suffering have been called “s-risks”.[^:`> S-risks are risks where an adverse outcome would bring about suffering on an astronomical scale, vastly exceeding all suffering that has existed on Earth so far.\n>\n> S-risks are a subclass of existential risk, often called x-risk... Nick Bostrom has defined x-risk as follows.\n>\n> “Existential risk – One where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential.”",

  "articles--existential-risks:669": "Another area to look at is major technological transitions. We’ve mentioned the dangers of genetic engineering and artificial intelligence in this piece, but these technologies could also create a second industrial revolution and do a huge amount of good once deployed. There might be things we can do to increase the likelihood of a good transition, rather than decrease the risk of a bad transition.

  "articles--existential-risks:673": "We agree that there might be other ways that we can have very long-term effects, and these might be more pressing than reducing the risk of extinction. However, most of these proposals are not yet as well worked out, and we’re not sure about what to do about them.",
  "articles--existential-risks:675": "The main practical upshot of considering these other ways to impact the future, is that we think it’s _even more_ important to positively manage the transition to new transformative technologies, like AI. It also makes us keener to see more global priorities research looking into these issues.",
  "articles--existential-risks:677": "Overall, we still think it makes sense to first focus on reducing existential threats, and then after that, we can turn our attention to other ways to help the future.",
  "articles--existential-risks:679": "One way to help the future we _don’t_ think is a contender is speeding it up. Some people who want to help the future focus on bringing about technological progress, like developing new vaccines, and it’s true that these create long-term benefits. However, we think what most matters from a long-term perspective is where we end up, rather than how fast we get there. Discovering a new vaccine probably means we get it earlier, rather than making it happen at all.",
  "articles--existential-risks:681": "Moreover, since technology is also the cause of many of these risks, it’s not clear how much speeding it up helps in the short-term.",
  "articles--existential-risks:683": "Speeding up progress is also far less neglected, since it benefits the present generation too. As we covered, over 1 trillion dollars is spent each year on R&D to develop new technology. So, speed-ups are both less important and less neglected.",

  "articles--existential-risks:703": "We agree there’s a significant chance civilisation ends soon (which is why this issue is so important), but we also think there’s a large _enough_ chance that it could last a very long time, which makes [the future worth fighting for](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/).",
  "articles--existential-risks:705": "Similarly, if you think it’s likely the future will be more bad than good, then the value of reducing these risks goes down (or if we have much more obligation to reduce suffering than increase wellbeing). We don’t think this is likely, however, because people _want_ the future to be good, so we’ll _try_ to make it more good than bad. We also think that there has been significant moral progress over the last few centuries (due to the trends noted earlier), and we’re optimistic this will continue. See more discussion in footnote 11.[^:`Is the world improving?",
  "articles--existential-risks:707": "Although most measures of progress seem to be increasing (as covered in the article), there are some ways that life might have become worse. For instance, in [_Sapiens_](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095), Yuval Harari argues that loneliness and mental health problems have increased in the modern age, while our sense of purpose and meaning might have decreased. We're sceptical that these downsides offset the gains, but it's hard to be confident.",
  "articles--existential-risks:709": "A stronger case that the world is getting worse comes if you consider our impact on animals. In particular, since the 1960s factory farming has grown dramatically, and there are now [perhaps well over 30 billion animals](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/) living in terrible conditions in factory farms each year. If we care about the suffering of these animals, then it could outweigh the gains in human welfare.",

  "articles--existential-risks:713": "Will the future be better?",
  "articles--existential-risks:715": "Our view is that -- so long as we avoid extinction -- increasing technology and moral progress give us the opportunity to our worst social problems, and have much better lives in the future. Putting existential threats to one side, if we consider specific global problems, many of them could be fixed with greater wealth, technology, and more moral and political progress of the kind we've seen.",
  "articles--existential-risks:717": "For instance, in the case of factory farming, we expect that as people get richer, the problem will reduce. First, wealthy people are more likely to buy products with high welfare standards because it’s less cost to them. Second, technology has the potential to end factory farming by creating meat substitutes, cultured meat, or less harmful farming practices. Third, moral concern for other beings seems to have increased over time -- the \"expanding moral circle\" -- so we expect that people in the future will have more concern for animal welfare.",
  "articles--existential-risks:719": "If we zoom out further, ultimately we expect the future to be better because people want it to be better. As we get more technological power and freedom, people are better able to achieve their values. Since people _want_ a good future, it’s more likely to improve than get worse.",
  "articles--existential-risks:721": "All this said, there are many complications to this picture. For instance, many of our values stand in tension with others, and this could cause conflict. These questions about what the future holds have also received little research. So, although we expect a better future, we admit a great deal of uncertainty.`]",
  "articles--existential-risks:723": "What’s more, even if you’re not sure how good the future will be, or suspect it will be bad in ways we may be able to prevent in the future, you may want civilisation to survive and keep its options open. People in the future will have much more time to study whether it’s desirable for civilisation to expand, stay the same size, or shrink. If you think there’s a good chance we will be able to act on those moral concerns, that’s a good reason to leave any final decisions to the wisdom of future generations. Overall, we’re highly uncertain about these big-picture questions, but that generally makes us _more_ concerned to avoid making any irreversible commitments.[^:`Unless you also don't think that moral inquiry is possible, don’t think moral progress will actually be made, or you have a theory of moral uncertainty that doesn't imply it's better to keep options open.`]",
