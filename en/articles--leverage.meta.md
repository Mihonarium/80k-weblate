<meta property="og:description" content="One of the most common career paths for people who want to do good is healthcare. So we worked with a doctor, Greg Lewis, to estimate the number of lives saved by a typical clinical doctor in the UK. Greg estimated that the average doctor enables the people they treat to live several hundred years of extra healthy life over the course of their career -- equivalent to saving several lives. This is a lot of impact compared to most jobs, but it&#39;s less than many expect (and we think less than many of the careers we recommend most highly)."/>
