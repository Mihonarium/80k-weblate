<meta property="og:description" content="People who want to have an impact often focus on jobs in which they help people directly -- for instance, teaching and healthcare are two of the most common paths for college graduates. So we worked with a medic, Greg Lewis, to estimate the number of lives saved by a typical clinical doctor. Greg estimated that the average doctor in a country like the US or UK adds several hundred years of healthy life over their career -- equivalent to saving several lives. This is a lot of impact compared to most jobs, but itâ€™s less than many expect."/>
