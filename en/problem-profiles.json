To learn about this framework, see our [introductory article on prioritising world problems](/articles/most-pressing-problems/).","problem-profiles:0879":"To assess the problems based on this framework, we mainly draw upon research and advice from subject-matter experts and advisors in the effective altruism research community, including the [Global Priorities Institute](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/), [Rethink Priorities](https://rethinkpriorities.org/), and [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research), though we also make some of our own judgement calls in borderline cases.","problem-profiles:0881":"To see the reasons why we listed each individual problem, click through to see the full profiles.","problem-profiles:0883":"Assessments of the scale and tractability of different global issues depend on your values and worldview.

We think that mitigating these risks, while increasing the chance these technologies [allow future generations to flourish](/articles/future-generations/), may be the [crucial challenge of this century](/articles/extinction-risk/). Though there is a growing movement working to address these issues, work on mitigating many risks remains remarkably neglected — in some cases receiving attention from only a handful of researchers.\n- **Building capacity to explore problems.** Comparing global issues involves lots of uncertainty and difficult judgement calls, and there have been [surprisingly few](/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/#4-highly-neglected-field) serious attempts to make such big-picture comparisons, so we’re strongly in favour of work that might help resolve some of this uncertainty — whether in the form of research or in the form of trying to see what works in more speculative areas.\n- **Building communities to solve problems.** We think it can be extremely valuable to invest in organisations and communities of people who are trying to do good as effectively as possible. We’re especially keen to build the [effective altruism community](/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/), because it explicitly aims to work on whichever global challenges will be most pressing in the future.

Moreover, it seems like some of the issues in the world that are biggest in scale — especially those that could affect the entire future of humanity, like mitigating risks from AI or biorisks — are also among the most neglected.

This increases the importance we place on reducing existential risks and on shaping other events that could affect the long-run future.","problem-profiles:0972":"If we were to reject longtermism, issues that contribute to existential risk would stand out much less (including most of our top-recommended issues), while issues like [ending factory farming](/problem-profiles/factory-farming/), [improving global health](/problem-profiles/health-in-poor-countries/), speeding up economic growth, improving science, and migration reform would all be boosted.","problem-profiles:0974":"That said, even if we rejected longtermism, we still think positively shaping AI and reducing the chance of a catastrophic pandemic would be top problems for more people to work on due to their large near-term and medium-term effects, as well as their neglectedness.","problem-profiles:0976":"You can read about some counterarguments to longtermism on our [page about it](/articles/future-generations/) and in the second half of [this article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism).","problem-profiles:0978":"Of course there are other parts of our broad worldview that could be badly wrong — you can read about some of them in the articles in the [foundations section of our key ideas series](/key-ideas/#2-foundations-what-does-it-mean-to-make-a-difference).","problem-profiles:0980":"Another major worry we have about the lists is that there’s an important issue we haven’t even thought of, but _should_ be among our top-ranked issues. We sometimes call this the possibility of finding a ‘ [Cause X](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/moral-progress-and-cause-x).’ The possibility of finding Cause X is one reason why we rate further research and capacity-building so highly.","problem-profiles:0982":"Finally, we could easily be wrong about any of the particular issues we list — maybe some are much bigger or smaller than we think, or turn out to be more or less tractable. For example, perhaps the development of AI will be largely safe by default.

These other factors also really matter — you may well be able to have 100 times the impact in an opportunity that’s a better fit, and this can easily make it higher impact to work on an issue you think is less pressing in general.","problem-profiles:0999":"Moreover, as our audience expands, we need to think more in terms of a ‘portfolio’ of effort by our readers, which creates additional reasons for members to spread out (we cover this in more detail in our [article on coordination](/articles/coordination/#there-are-more-reasons-to-spread-out-over-opportunities)). Two of the most important such reasons are:","problem-profiles:1001":"- As more people work on an issue, it gets less neglected, and there are [diminishing returns](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/diminishing-returns/) to additional work. This means that a group of people that’s large compared to the capacity of an issue to absorb people will start to run out of fruitful opportunities to make progress on that issue, making it better for new people to spread out into other areas.\n- If you work with others, there is [value of information](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/value-of-information/) in exploring new world problems — if you explore an area and find out that it’s promising, other people can enter it as well.","problem-profiles:1004":"Among people who follow our advice, we aim to help a majority shoot for one of the top world problems [we list above](#most-pressing-world-problems), but we’d also like 10–20% to work on the second longer list, and perhaps another 10–20% to work on the others.","problem-profiles:1006":"If we consider the world as a whole, not just our readers, it’s even more obvious they shouldn’t all work on our top-ranked issues. The world wouldn’t function if everyone tried to work on AI safety and preventing pandemics. Clearly, we need people working on a wide range of issues, as well as keeping society running and taking care of themselves and their families.","problem-profiles:1008":"However, in practice it’s safe to assume that what most of the world will do will remain unaffected by what we say.
