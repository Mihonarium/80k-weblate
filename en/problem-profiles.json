We think that mitigating these risks, while increasing the chance these technologies [allow future generations to flourish](/articles/future-generations/), may be the [crucial challenge of this century](/articles/extinction-risk/). Though there is a growing movement working to address these issues, work on mitigating many risks remains remarkably neglected — in some cases receiving attention from only a handful of researchers.\n- **Building capacity to explore problems.** Comparing global issues involves lots of uncertainty and difficult judgement calls, and there have been [surprisingly few](/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/#4-highly-neglected-field) serious attempts to make such big-picture comparisons, so we’re strongly in favour of work that might help resolve some of this uncertainty — whether in the form of research or in the form of trying to see what works in more speculative areas.\n- **Building communities to solve problems.** We think it can be extremely valuable to invest in organisations and communities of people who are trying to do good as effectively as possible. We’re especially keen to build the [effective altruism community](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/), because it explicitly aims to work on whichever global challenges will be most pressing in the future.

Moreover, it seems like some of the issues in the world that are biggest in scale — especially those that could affect the entire future of humanity, like mitigating risks from AI or biorisks — are also among the most neglected. This combination means you can have an outsized impact by helping tackle them.","problem-profiles:0805":"For this reason, we think our most important advice for people who want to make a big positive difference with their careers is to choose a very pressing problem to work on.

All else equal, you are likely to be able to do far more good in an area that is not getting the attention it deserves.","problem-profiles:0821":"One way to think about this is in terms of a ‘world portfolio’: What would the ideal allocation of resources be for all social causes?

This increases the importance we place on reducing existential risks and on shaping other events that could affect the long-run future.","problem-profiles:0877":"If we were to reject longtermism, issues that contribute to existential risk would stand out much less (including most of our top-recommended issues), while issues like [ending factory farming](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/), [improving global health](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/health-in-poor-countries/), speeding up economic growth, improving science, and migration reform would all be boosted.","problem-profiles:0879":"That said, even if we rejected longtermism, we still think positively shaping AI and reducing the chance of a catastrophic pandemic would be top problems for more people to work on due to their large near-term and medium-term effects, as well as their neglectedness.","problem-profiles:0881":"You can read about some counterarguments to longtermism on our [page about it](https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/) and in the second half of [this article](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism).","problem-profiles:0883":"Of course there are other parts of our broad worldview that could be badly wrong — you can read about some of them in the articles in the [foundations section of our key ideas series](/key-ideas/#2-foundations-what-does-it-mean-to-make-a-difference).","problem-profiles:0885":"Another major worry we have about the lists is that there’s an important issue we haven’t even thought of, but _should_ be among our top-ranked issues.
