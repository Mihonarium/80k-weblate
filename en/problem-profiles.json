Though there is a growing movement working to address these issues, work on mitigating many risks remains remarkably neglected — in some cases receiving attention from only a handful of researchers.\n- **Building capacity to explore problems.** Comparing global issues involves lots of uncertainty and difficult judgement calls, and there have been [surprisingly few](/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/#4-highly-neglected-field) serious attempts to make such big-picture comparisons, so we’re strongly in favour of work that might help resolve some of this uncertainty — whether in the form of research or in the form of trying to see what works in more speculative areas.\n- **Building communities to solve problems.** We think it can be extremely valuable to invest in organisations and communities of people who are trying to do good as effectively as possible. We’re especially keen to build the [effective altruism community](/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/), because it explicitly aims to work on whichever global challenges will be most pressing in the future.

Moreover, it seems like some of the issues in the world that are biggest in scale — especially those that could affect the entire future of humanity, like mitigating risks from AI or biorisks — are also among the most neglected.
