<meta property="og:description" content="We think there&#39;s less tension between the two than is often supposed. Finding work you excel at and that helps others is fulfilling, and many of our readers say they&#39;ve become happier in the process. Moreover, you&#39;ll have a greater impact if you find work you enjoy and that fits with your personal life, because you&#39;ll have a greater chance of excelling in the long term. So enjoying your work and having an impact are often mutually supportive goals."/>
