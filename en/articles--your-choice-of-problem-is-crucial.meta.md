<meta property="og:description" content="If you want to make a difference, which issue is best to work on -- climate change, education, pandemics, or something else? People often think that making these kinds of comparisons is near impossible. The most common advice is that you should just work on whatever issue youâ€™re passionate about. But we believe some global problems are far bigger and more neglected than others, and so which issues you work on will probably be the biggest driver of your impact."/>
